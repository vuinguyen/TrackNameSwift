# TrackNameSwift

This was the program I had to write for my 1st technical interview with Trello. This program was written in 45 minutes while pair programming with another iOS developer at Trello. It was written in Swift 2.2. 

The program is an iOS mobile app that displays track names from a U2 album. 

It does this by calling a web service, parses and displays the incoming JSON data into a TableView, and displays that table within a mobile app. The UI is very simple with no design, because the point was to get the functionality working within a very short (45 minutes!) period of time. 

But I got the program done and working within the allotted period of time. 

Look at the png file for a screenshot of the app in action.
